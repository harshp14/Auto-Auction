# Auto Auction
 
## Inspiration
Our inspiration for our project came from our personal experiences with auction sites like eBay. In these auction sites, bids can be placed to outbid another and that bid does not have to be paid effectively denying your purchases or making a bid at a higher price. So we thought of ways to fix this issue and make the e-commerce websites like these much better for everyone.

## What it does
We created a smart auctioning service that securely guarantees both payments and product deliveries. This service only confirms bids placed if the bidder is able to fulfill the bid and is serious about getting the object bid on. This service is also able to register users with all their information, search for listings, place a listing, and bid on listings. 

## How we built it
The language we used was Python and we incorporated many different libraries into our code. Some of the main libraries we used were Tkinter which is what we used to make our graphical user interface on, a free use Azure style theme that cleaned up our interfaces to look more modern, and Pillow to display images on the GUIs. We also want to mention the APIs that we used such as the Google Cloud API and the Twilio service APIs to store data and send messages.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges since this was the first Hackathon for most of us, we needed to be ready to work in a virtual environment together and learn how to use libraries we have never incorporated into code before. The power outage affected us hard taking away a lot of working time from two of our team members for multiple hours pushing our work behind. Other challenges also came from the Google Cloud service integration for the data we needed to store and our Twilio integration to send messages to mobile phones via SMS. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our final product as it looks very sleek and modern while implementing everything we brainstormed with more features we added along the way. We are also proud of all our functions working in the final code for every possible interaction our code could have faced. We even managed to pull ahead with all the challenges we faced to pull off a great working product. 

## What we learned
We learned how to manage over 100 Tkinter widgets and how we can use Python Polymorphism to share data across our platform. We also learned how robust the data management tools provided by google are and how flexible they can be to serve our needs. Twillio is the first service API that we used that accessed phone numbers and we were able to use it to verify users successfully.

## What's next for Auto-Auction
The following steps are improving the speed of our application or thinking about transitioning into a web-based application. We also aim to bring this application onto mobile devices, and over multi-factor authentication using email. We also have a goal to make Auto-Auction
